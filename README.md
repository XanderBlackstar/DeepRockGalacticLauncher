# DeepRockGalacticLauncher

Deep Rock Galactic Launcher to manage save games between XBox game pass and Steam.

This is a piece of software for those who want to be able to play Deep Rock Galactic on both XBox game pass and Steam. But don't want the hassle of having to copy their save file back and fourth every time they want to play.

Deep Rock Galactic Launcher will encapsulate any gaming session on either service (as long as the gaming session is started through the launcher). And then save a copy of the save file produced to the local vault folder. This latest vault save is then deployed to the launched service before launching. Thus you will always have your latest save deployed to whatever service you want to play the game on.

## Make sure to make a backup of your save game, before using this program. Use at your own risk! We take no responsiblity for lost data.
